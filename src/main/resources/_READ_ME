Clues on WTAF is meant to happen & how to demonstrate it ...

Based on (effectively a copy of) spring.io starter guide at
    http://spring.io/guides/gs/producing-web-service/

Once it's running, use Postman or similar to call it.

BODY needs to look like:

    <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                      xmlns:gs="http://spring.io/guides/gs-producing-web-service">
       <soapenv:Header/>
       <soapenv:Body>
          <gs:getCountryRequest>
             <gs:name>Poland</gs:name>
          </gs:getCountryRequest>
       </soapenv:Body>
    </soapenv:Envelope>

HEADER needs to look like
    Content-Type  =  text/xml


    Get the header for free if change (in Postman) body type to "raw" & then in the drop down at right pick XML (text/xml)


Currently auto-generates from the XSD file (in resources) to io.spring.guides.gs-producing-web-service, which I believe
is picked up from the xsd file.  No point having it in git as it auto-generates.  Can augment the stuff it generates
but other stuff won't pick up on it (the XSD -> WSDL -> used by clients of this server)

Get wsdl via : http://localhost:8080/ws/countries.wsdl


Could look at amending the Name Space at some point ...
